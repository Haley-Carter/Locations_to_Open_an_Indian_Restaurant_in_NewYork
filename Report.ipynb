    "Starting a restaurant business is no less than a herculean task. In a market where everybody wants to open a restaurant there are few things which restaurateurs have to keep in mind before starting up the business which includes cuisine, ambience, quality, services and location. Choosing a happening place could help restaurateurs keep an upper hand in the market. A happening place would grant you with happening consumers. Not everyone belongs to everywhere. Same, not every place is for restaurant. It is really difficult than some people think it might. A place could take you to the heights or could even turn into dud. Like, how would you reach to the consumers if itâ€™s not in the right place? No consumers mean No business. It is as straight as that.\n",

    "In this work, we will try to find an optimal location for a restaurant. Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an **Indian restaurant** in **New York**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are lots of restaurants in New York we will try to detect **locations that are not already crowded with restaurants**. We are also particularly interested in **areas with no Indian restaurants**. We would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."

    "Result of all this was 2 zones containing largest number of potential new restaurant locations based on number of and distance to existing venues - both restaurants in general and Indian restaurants particularly. This, of course, does not imply that those zones are actually optimal locations for a new restaurant! Purpose of this analysis was to only provide info on areas close to busy centers of the city, but not crowded with existing restaurants (particularly Indian) - it is entirely possible that there is a very good reason for small number of restaurants in any of those areas, reasons which would make them unsuitable for a new restaurant regardless of lack of competition in the area. Recommended zones should therefore be considered only as a starting point for more detailed analysis which could eventually result in location which has not only no nearby competition but also other factors taken into account and all other relevant conditions met."

By calculating restaurant density distribution from Foursquare data we have first identified general neighborhoods that justify further analysis, and then generated extensive collection of locations which satisfy some basic requirements regarding existing nearby restaurants. After which major zones of interest (containing greatest number of potential locations) and addresses of those zone centers were created to be used as starting points for final exploration by stakeholders.\n",
